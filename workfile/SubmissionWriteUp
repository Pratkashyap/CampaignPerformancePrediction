For TASK 1, TASK 2 & TASK 3
NOTE: Using MacOS machine and Jupytr notebook for analysis

--To perform the analaysis we need to install all the libraries as mentioned in the script.
--Since I was not able to install MYSQL db on cloud as it wanted a paid version hence i have done this analysis 
  by reading the data from my local machines using pandas.
--Foolowing are my credentials which i tried to connect to the DB: 
                      import MySQLdb

                      db=MySQLdb.connect(
                          host='prateekkashyap.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com',
                          user='prateekkashyap',
                          passwd='Nov@2019',
                          db='prateekkashyap$campaign')

--Hence I would request you to kindly accept this solution of mine and evaluste accordingly.
--Also i have fulfilled all the requirments as mentioned in all the TASKS 1,2,3
--I have mentioned all the data preparation steps in comments in my script.
--To perform EDA i have used a new library called as pandas_profiling but its solution is not visible if i save it in github
  Hence i will be send the solution file in email separately.
--I have tried Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, GradientBoost Regression for this analysis.
--since there were multi-target regression to be done hence I have created multiple model to predict 
   each IMPRESSION and CLICKS.
--To measure the performance of the model i have used Train, Tet and Validation sets of the data and used
  MAE, MSE, RMSE & Rsquare to evaluate the best performing model.
--the accuracy of the test and validation sets were not to varying hence there was no under & over fitting in the data.
--Over all we got XGBoost regressor as best model to predict IMPRESSIONS & RF regressor as best model to predict CLICKS.
--Finally with the best performing models i have predicted the results for next week as per the requirements.


TASK 4

--For this i have installed Spark on my local machine and have installed all the libraries and data from local machine.
--For TASK 4 ie movie recommendation i have created a separate repository with my analysis. Hence would request you to 
  kindly refer to it as well.
